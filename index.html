            <p>While playing Division 1 basketball in college, I was the captain of my team for two years. This leadership position included the responsibility to communicate team goals to the coaching staff, while motivating and empowering my fellow teammates to succeed.</p>
            <p>Post-college, I spent a year as an ambassador for a non-profit organization called Sport Changes Life. With this program, I spent a year living in Ireland. The goal was to coach and mentor underprivledged children throughout the country, while emphasizing and promoting the value of sports as a means to change lives. During this year, I also played basketball at the highest level in Ireland and studied to receive my masters. Being a role model to children while having to manage my time to fulfill my responsibilities allowed me to grow as both a leader and a person.</p>

            <p>I have been working as a consultant for First Derivatives PLC for the past 1.5 years. Currently, I am working on a project at Morgan Stanley as a Business Analyst. The goal of this project is to develop two new applications to automate business processes around certain regulatory report filings. My everyday duties include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Meeting with the client to understand business processes and current problems</li>
                <li>Gathering and documenting requirements for the development of applications</li>
                <li>Communicating the business users' requests to the development team</li>
                <li>Organizing and prioritizing user requests</li>
                <li>Training users on new applications</li>
                <li>Working with other project teams to prioritize tasks and work towards a common goal</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This project has allowed me to gain experience in the finance technology industry, and I am always looking to network or learn of new opportunities within this industry.</p>
